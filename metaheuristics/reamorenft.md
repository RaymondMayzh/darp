### The no free lunch (NFL) theorem

At this point it’s worth bringing up the infamous No Free Lunch Theorem, or NFL, by David Wolpert and William Macready. The NFL stated that within certain constraints, over the space of all possible problems, every optimization technique will perform as well as every other one on average (including Random Search). That is, if there exists a set of problems P for which technique A beats technique B by a certain amount, there also exists an equal-sized set of problems P) for which the opposite is true. This is of considerable theoretical interest but, I think, of limited practical value, because the space of all possible problems likely includes many extremely unusual and pathological problems
which are rarely if ever seen in practice. In my opinion, of more of interest is what kinds of techniques perform well on the typical problems faced by practitioners, and why. For more on the NFL, see
